# MNIST Digit Classification - Deep Learning Basics

A simple introduction to deep learning using handwritten digit recognition.

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental deep learning concepts by:
- **Splitting** the MNIST dataset into two parts for experimentation
- **Training** neural networks on different data subsets
- **Saving** model weights for future research and transfer learning

## 🎯 Purpose
- **Learning Goal**: First steps into deep learning and neural networks
- **Data Strategy**: Split dataset approach for comparative analysis
- **Research Foundation**: Saved models serve as baseline for advanced experiments

## 📁 Files
- `model1.ipynb` - Training on MNIST Part 1
- `model2.ipynb` - Training on MNIST Part 2  
- `*.h5` files - Saved model weights for research

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy`
2. Run notebooks to train models on split datasets
3. Models automatically save for future use

## 💡 Key Learning
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Neural network architecture design
- Model training and validation
- Weight persistence for transfer learning

*This project serves as a stepping stone for more complex deep learning research.*
